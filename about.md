My name is Evan and coaching track and field is a passion of mine. I have been fortunate enough to work with some incredible athletes at all levels. My mission is to help any athlete at any level to find success in track and field.

My training is focused not only specific practice plans but also teaching the fundamental knowledge on how to be successful in this sport!

### In The News
From "Woicik Has a Passion for Coaching Track" on [Zip06](https://www.zip06.com/person-of-the-week/20220308/woicik-has-a-passion-for-coaching-track/)
> Track really teaches the principle of self-competition. As an athlete, you are contributing to a team, but ultimately, the competition day in and day out is with yourself,” Evan says. “Each kid, each week needs to focus on being a better version of themselves than they were the day before. I think that is a valuable life lesson, as well.”

### Words from Brody Rheault
Former decathlete at CCSU
> Evan Woicik is more than a coach to me, he is a mentor. Although the skills Evan helped me develop tremendously impacted my high school career, it's life outside of track where I am most grateful for having had him as a coach. I use the word mentor because he showed me how to care for others. It might sound silly, but the way I go about treating myself and others in this world goes through a WWED filter (What Would Evan Do). I hold myself to a standard of care in life that Evan would be proud of. That includes taking care of my health, my fitness, my education, my passions, my family, my friends, and my relationships. I owe a lot of my success in life to Evan. He is an incredibly humble person so he won't admit this, but he changes the lives of nearly every athlete he works with. He provides them with knowledge that will make you better at your sport, and wisdom that will mold you into a better person beyond the track.
